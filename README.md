The competition has innovative methodology but offers limited classes in limited schedule options. The differencial about Flow is the flexibility in schedule and genuine care for the clients, besides offering more space and even private rooms. Also, the owner temporarely moved to India to learn the best practices and learn from the best. The company focuses on quality and constantly asks for feedback for improvements.
